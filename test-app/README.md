This project was built using the yo ro-react boilerplate template.  It uses the following technologies

## Background info
This starter pack uses the following tech:

##### FrontEnd
* React
* Redux

##### Backend
* Node/Express

##### Testing
* Mocha
* Chai
* SuperTest

One thing to note is that, most all of the basic configuration stuff that would usually go along with setting up a project has been abstracted out to an npm package called ro-utils. So you can focus on building the latest and greatest thing without a bunch of configuration code in the way. :)

## Install
    npm install
    npm start
    
## Testing
##### Main test script
    npm test

## Docs

Currently, the absolute best documentation for this starter package is going to be in the tests of all the modules.  This project strives to be as close to 100% coverage as possible at all times.
